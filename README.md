Structural Bionics and its Applications Based on GAN
=====================================

Code for wgan-gp and iGAN in tensorflow, and their applications in Structural Bionics.


## Prerequisites

- Python, NumPy, TensorFlow, SciPy, Matplotlib
- A recent NVIDIA GPU

## Training Models
- `python gan_bionics.py`:  Train wgan-gp on bamboo cross-section dataset.

## Optimization With User Constraints
- `python opt.py`:  Optimization with user constraints(color,sketch).
